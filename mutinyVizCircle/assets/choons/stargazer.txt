Been thinking how to escape?
This strait-jacket of constraint
Been thinking what can be wrong?
With feelings that long to belong
Stargazing me
In an upside down sea
So weary this strait-jacket*newline*dreamer
So resigned to continue to suffer
But you've learnt that as you*newline*grow weaker
There's less hurt because there's*newline*much less to hurt
Stargazing me
In a tumbling sea
Up in the galaxy
Staring down on me
 
Stargazer
 
Stargazer
Stargazer reach out to touch
With your mind that frees you*newline*so much
Stargazer kissing your kismet
With bright jewel encrusted scars
Stargazing me
In tranquillity
Up in the galaxy
Staring down on me
Stargazing me
In tranquillity
Up in the galaxy
Staring down on me
