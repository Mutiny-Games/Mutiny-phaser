		<h1>Stargazer Rainbow EQ Demo - Mutiny</h1>

		<!--<h6>NB. This is a quick draft write up knocked together VS Code. So if you find this looking a bit ropey or lacking in detail, this is why....</h6>
		<p>	This is my first experiment using <a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser</a> and I think it went pretty well.  
			Coded in TypeScript 1.5.0beta using Visual Studio Code as the editor. </p>
		<p>	It uses WebGL Canvas and Web API Audio which means that really you need a half decent GPU and, for now at least, should be using a recent version of Google Chrome. </p> 
		<p>	I used this experiment to learn TypeScript and Phaser at the same time and that was a fun process overall. </p>
		<p>	I implemented a video feed back system myself and tossed a couple of Phaser blur (blurX and blurY) shader filters over the top to decay the feedback to acheive the special effects on the splash screen.  
			The spinning of logo is driven by Phasers excellent and very powerful tweening system.</p> 
		<p>	Then on the main feature I tossed another standard Phaser shader filter into the background. 
			Added an OGG format music track, again a capability built in to Phaser. Interestingly I found that OGG worked much better than any other format as it decoded very quickly which is why I used it. 
			The bitmap font text uses Phasers retro font feature which was super simple and the font bitmap is one stolen from the Phaser Examples. 
			I manually arrived at the timings for the song lyrics which should appear in close syncronization with vocals, depending on your systems performance. 
			Then I added a simple specturm analyser which was also fun to work out as Phaser itself does not provide this functionality.</p>
